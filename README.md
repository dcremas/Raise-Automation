### Title: RAISE Invoice Automation Project

#### Background:

#### On a daily basis, at approximately 7:30am CST, an email is sent from RAISE to the designated process owners mail inbox (gmail).  The daily email contains a .pdf file containing the amount of the redemptions from the prior day as well as the current escrow balance.  These two values are then inputted into a master Microsoft Excel document for verification.  Once this step is successful, the original email is then forwarded to the Accounting department contact for processing.  This is to ensure timely processing of the invoice so that payment to the vendor is not delayed. Periodic follow up is then done to verify that all steps of the process were completed successfully.

#### Description:

#### The goal is to build Python scripts that automate these 'routine' financial daily tasks.  By applying this approach to the RAISE process, any learnings, enhanced know how and structure created can then be used to apply to other financial processes.

##### Libraries:

- Utilize the Google GMAIL API libraries via Python (google-api-core, google-auth, google-api-python-client, etc).
- Utilize the Microsoft Excel API library via Python (openpyxl).
- Utilize the Adobe Acrobat API library via Python (pypdf).
